# AI Developer Specification: Retro Snake Game

This document outlines the requirements and technical specifications for implementing a classic Snake game using vanilla web technologies. Please implement the game according to these guidelines.

## Project Overview
**Goal:** Create a polished, responsive, and visually appealing implementation of the classic Snake arcade game.
**Tech Stack:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (No external frameworks or libraries).

## Core Requirements

### 1. Game Mechanics
- **Grid System:** The game operates on a fixed grid (e.g., 20x20 tiles).
- **Movement:**
  - The snake moves continuously in the current direction.
  - Controls: Arrow keys or WASD to change direction.
  - Prevent 180-degree turns (e.g., cannot go immediately Left if moving Right).
- **Growth:**
  - When the snake's head occupies the same tile as food, the snake grows by one segment.
  - Score increases.
  - New food spawns at a random valid location (not on the snake body).
- **Game Over Conditions:**
  - Head collides with the wall (game boundary).
  - Head collides with any part of the snake's own body.
- **Game Loop:**
  - Updates occur at a fixed interval (e.g., every 100ms) to create the retro "step" feel.

### 2. User Interface (UI)
- **Start Screen:** Overlay showing the title and a "Start Game" button.
- **HUD (Heads-Up Display):**
  - Current Score.
  - High Score (persisted in `localStorage`).
- **Game Over Screen:**
  - Overlay displayed upon death.
  - Shows Final Score.
  - "Play Again" button to reset the game state.

### 3. Visual Design (CSS)
- **Theme:** Dark, retro arcade aesthetic.
  - Background: Dark grey or black (`#2c3e50`, `#000000`).
  - Colors: High contrast neon (Green snake, Red food).
- **Responsiveness:**
  - The game container should remain centered on the screen.
  - The canvas should have a fixed logical resolution (e.g., 400x400) but scale visually if needed.
- **Polish:**
  - Subtle shadows or glows for the snake/food.
  - Retro pixel font (e.g., "Press Start 2P" from Google Fonts).

## File Structure & Implementation Details

You should implement the solution using the following three files.

### 1. `index.html`
- Contains the main game container.
- Includes the `<canvas>` element.
- Includes UI overlays (Start Screen, Game Over Screen) within the container.
- Links `style.css` and `script.js`.

### 2. `style.css`
- Resets default browser margins.
- Uses Flexbox to center the game on the viewport.
- Styles the canvas with a distinct border.
- Styles the UI overlays to appear on top of the canvas (using absolute positioning).
- Implements the retro color palette.

### 3. `script.js`
- **Classes/Objects:**
  - `Game`: Manages the loop, score, and state transitions.
  - `Snake`: Manages the body array, movement, and growth logic.
  - `Food`: Manages position and random spawning.
- **Logic:**
  - Use `requestAnimationFrame` or `setInterval` for the game loop.
  - Handle input events (`keydown`).
  - Implement collision detection helper functions.
  - LocalStorage logic for high scores.

## Implementation Steps for Developer

1.  **Setup HTML:** Create the skeleton structure with canvas and UI elements.
2.  **Style:** Apply CSS to center the game and style the overlays (initially hidden or shown based on state).
3.  **Core Engine:** Write the JavaScript to render a static grid and snake.
4.  **Movement:** Implement the update loop to move the snake array.
5.  **Input:** Connect keyboard listeners to direction changes.
6.  **Gameplay:** Add food spawning, eating logic, and collision detection.
7.  **Polish:** Add scoring, high score persistence, and game states (Start/Game Over).

**Note to Developer:** Please ensure the code is clean, well-commented, and assumes no build step is required (pure vanilla JS).
